# ERPM - Evil Rave Package Manager
ERPM is an alternative to the RavePM, written in Python.

ERPM also supports multiple repositories with different priorities, updating the 'aliases' file from the CLI, and also updating the packages.

# Installing
You need to have Python3, Git and 'requests' library for Python installed.

For Linux, just drop the 'erpm' file somewhere in PATH.

ERPM was not tested on Windows and will probably require more stuff to work.

# Using
Just run
> $ erpm
to see the options. It will create 'repolist' and 'aliases' files on the first run.

# Licensing
The ERPM project is licensed under GNU LGPL v3, see LICENSE file for more.
